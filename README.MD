# Observe
### By Isaac Young and George Powell
We noticed from our courses at university that there wasn't an easy way to provide anonymous feedback when feedback was needed and a way indicate which areas of feedback people felt strongly about. 
We concluded that this was a problem that we could fix, so we made Observe.
